description: A web application for teachers to easier manage courses at universities. The application works as a main navigation for all of the different sites which the teacher needs to use. With the help of the website the teacher can easily see what needs to be done before a course starts, manage the course during the course and end the course when it is finished. Lärarplattformen is built in ASP.NET CORE and has a database where all the information about the courses is stored. The frontend is made with ReactJS. My responsibility during the development was both in ASP.NET CORE and ReactJS.
