A web application for teachers to easier manage courses at universities. The application works as a main navigation for all of the different sites
which the teacher needs to use. With the help of the website the teacher can easily see what needs to be done before a course starts, manage the course
during the course and end the course when it is finished. Lärarplattformen is built in ASP.NET CORE and has a database where all the information about the
courses is stored. The frontend is made with ReactJS. My responsibility during the development was both in ASP.NET CORE and ReactJS.

## Improvements

Quo numquam, nunc [concussaque](http://mox-cunctos.net/), hora effugit mihi,
pectore. Hinc fausto, circumspicit cadas; virilibus rapui, timidum rorat cuique
animorum ac! Quem sit. Venit qui, rex sibi tota, peto _fortis ira suis_ dolusque
pavens](http://www.corpora.com/terrae-oscula.html) spatiosa conlegit oscula
equam.

## When

I developed the application myself during a summercourse at Umeå university and wrote the app in Java with Android Studio.
Before the course I had not worked with programming for android devices but I quickly understood the different structure 
and design principles for mobile devices.

## Tested on
