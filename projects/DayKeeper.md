description: An android application for keeping track of your memories. The purpose of the app is to help people remember thing they otherwise would forget. One of the biggest advantages with a phone is how easy it is to bring everywhere. Therefore the app is designed to be used to help people remeber things everywhere. The design of the app is made to help users store memories fast and smooth. A user can also save an image of the memory. Daykeeper also gives users the possibility to search among stored memories as well as sort memories. The app stores all the memorieslocally on the phone through Room, a library for storing data locally with SQL.

## When

I developed the application myself during a summercourse at Ume√• university and wrote the app in Java with Android Studio.
Before the course I had not worked with programming for android devices but I quickly understood the different structure 
and design principles for mobile devices.
