A visual clone of Spotify web app to improve my skills in frontend development. The web applciation mimics the UI of Spotify
and gives most of the features that Spotify uses through Spotify's API. To work, Spotify needs to be open on a device due to limitations in Spotfy's Web API. The web applciation supports showing all the users  playlists, changing active song, pause and play, next song and previous song. 

## Link
[Github](https://github.com/HawkieOne/spotify-clone)

### Built With
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [Next Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/)
* [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/)
* [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)

## Getting Started

This is an instruction to setting up your project locally.

### Installation

Below is an example of how you can install and set up your app.

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/HawkieOne/spotify-clone
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Limitations

Due to limitations in Spotify's API it is not possible to run the web application without having Spotify active 
on another device. To be considered an active device it is simply required to play or pause a song in Spotify. 
When this is done the music can be controlled through this web application
