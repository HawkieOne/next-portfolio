description: A visual clone of Spotify web app to improve my skills in frontend development. The web applciation mimics the UI of Spotify and gives most of the features that Spotify uses through Spotify's API. To work, Spotify needs to be open on a device due to limitations in Spotify's Web API. The web applciation supports showing all the users  playlists, changing active song, pause and play, next song and previous song.

limitations: Due to limitations in Spotify's API it is not possible to run the web application without having Spotify active on another device. To be considered an active device it is simply required to play or pause a song in Spotify. When this is done the music can be controlled through this web application
