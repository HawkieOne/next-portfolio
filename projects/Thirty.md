description: Thirty is a mobile game which is similar to Yatzy. It was my very first application made on Android. The app is very simple but I am still very proud of it since it had some fancy function like color coding of the results. The app is made in Java with Android Studio.

limitations: 'The app works as supposed and does not have any known bugs. It is a rather small game and app and is therefore seen as completed.' 
when: 'I developed the application myself during a summercourse at Ume√• university and wrote the app in Java with Android Studio. Before the course I had not worked with programming for android devices but I quickly understood the different structure and design principles for mobile devices.'
tested: ['Xiaomi Mi 9 - Android 10']
