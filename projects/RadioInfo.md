Radio Info is a program that fetches data from SR(Sveriges Radio) public API to show a scehdule over radio programs. Both passed programs 
and future programs is shown. The program is made in Java with Swing and was made during a course at Ume√• University. The program uses different 
threads though Java Swing to be able to download and show data without freezing the main UI.
