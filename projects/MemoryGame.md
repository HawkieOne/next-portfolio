A simple memory game. Match the same cards in as few turns as possible. The web application is built with React and was made to improve my knowledge of states
in React. The web application also use CSS animations to improve the user experience.

## Improvements

Quo numquam, nunc [concussaque](http://mox-cunctos.net/), hora effugit mihi,
pectore. Hinc fausto, circumspicit cadas; virilibus rapui, timidum rorat cuique
animorum ac! Quem sit. Venit qui, rex sibi tota, peto _fortis ira suis_ dolusque
pavens](http://www.corpora.com/terrae-oscula.html) spatiosa conlegit oscula

## When

I developed the application myself during a summercourse at Ume√• university and wrote the app in Java with Android Studio.
Before the course I had not worked with programming for android devices but I quickly understood the different structure 
and design principles for mobile devices.

## Tested on
